# ML Run Summary

## Validation Strategy: Static
> **Static Validation**: The model is trained *once* on a fixed historical period (e.g., 2017-2022) and tested on a subsequent unseen period (e.g., 2023-Present). This mimics a 'set and forget' approach and tests how well a single model generalizes over time without retraining.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Method**: Static (single train/val split)
- **CV Folds**: 1
