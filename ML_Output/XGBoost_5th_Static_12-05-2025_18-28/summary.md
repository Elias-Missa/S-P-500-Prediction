# ML Run Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-05 18:28:05
## Validation Strategy: Static
> **Static Validation**: The model is trained *once* on a fixed historical period (e.g., 2017-2022) and tested on a subsequent unseen period (e.g., 2023-Present). This mimics a 'set and forget' approach and tests how well a single model generalizes over time without retraining.

## Configuration
- **Model**: `XGBoost`
- **Target Horizon**: 21 days (Predicting return 1 month ahead)
- **Train Window**: None years
- **Val Window**: 6 months
- **Buffer**: 21 days (Embargo to prevent leakage)
- **Test Start**: 2023-01-01

## Model Parameters
- N Estimators: 100
- Learning Rate: 0.1

## Metrics Explanation
### Standard Metrics
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The average magnitude of the prediction error. Lower is better.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average absolute difference between predicted and actual returns. Lower is better.
- **Directional Accuracy**: The percentage of time the model correctly predicted the *sign* (Up/Down) of the return. >50% is the goal.
### Advanced Metrics
- **IC (Information Coefficient)**: The Spearman correlation between predictions and actuals. Measures how well the model ranks returns. >0.05 is good, >0.10 is excellent.
- **Strategy Return**: The cumulative return of a simple strategy: Long if Pred > 0, Short if Pred < 0.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Annualized risk-adjusted return of the strategy. >1.0 is good.
- **Max Drawdown**: The largest percentage drop from a peak in the strategy's equity curve. Smaller magnitude (closer to 0) is better.
### Big Shift Analysis (>5%)
Focuses on extreme moves (market crashes or rallies) greater than 5% in a month.
- **Precision**: When the model predicts a Big Move, how often is it right? (High Precision = Few False Alarms).
- **Recall**: When a Big Move actually happens, how often did the model predict it? (High Recall = Few Missed Opportunities).

## Results
### Validation (In-Sample / Tuning)

- Directional Accuracy: 60.16%

### Test (Out of Sample)
- RMSE: 0.067757
- MAE: 0.054957
- Directional Accuracy: 36.66%
- IC: 0.1096
- Strategy Return: -4.7384
- Sharpe Ratio: -0.59
- Max Drawdown: -6.5091

#### Big Shift Details
- Precision (Up): 1.00 (Count: 2)
- Recall (Up): 0.02 (Count: 97)
- Precision (Down): 0.03 (Count: 158)
- Recall (Down): 0.15 (Count: 33)
